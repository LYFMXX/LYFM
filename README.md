MetaMotion R to Fitness Industries
First, my english is solala. <== Thats french, means i can explaine myself in english but not allways 100% clear.
I am working on a idea. I use MetaMotion R from Mbientlabs for this Idea. www.mbientlabs. com
My idea is simple. I have a vision... combining electronic messurement with the variability of a human. 
I am using various sensors like accelerometers, magnetometers. gyrosensors etc, to detect human performances
Waht i need?
Coding support. There is allready a opensource code from mbientlab. But.. its just the beginning...
